# Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a way of expressing algoritm using syntax that is independent of any particular programming language. The Algorithm can be coded in a suitable programming language.

### Converting pseudocode to a high-level language
Generally, is it quite straightforward to convert preudocode to a high-level language, but we need to be carefull and look out for area where the sintax is "similar but different", and may we will be compuse. In particular, think carefully about [**count-controlled loops**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrxncdm/revision/5).
