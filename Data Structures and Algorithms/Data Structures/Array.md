# Array
An **[Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array)** is a data structures that holds a number of data items or elements of the same data type. When you want to store many pieces of data that are related and have the same data type,if is often better to use an array instead of many separate variables.

Each position in an array is identified by an index, most language use zero-based indexing which means that the indexing start at 0 (Zero). The value stored in array are mutable, which mean they can be changed while the program is running, just like a content of variable.
