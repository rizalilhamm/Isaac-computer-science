# Linked List
**Linked list** is a dynamic data structures that means the size of the list can be change at run time, we can imagine that the linked list as a chain where each link is connected to the next one to form and sequence with start and an end.

each element in linked list called **Node** that contain:
1. The data relating to the element
2. A pointer to the next node

Some method that available in Linked List:
1. Traversing a linked list
2. Adding a new node
3. Delete a node

# Circular Linked list
**Circular Linked lists** are type of linked list which the last node point back to the **head** of the list instead of pointing to the Node, this what make them circular, circular linked list have quite a few interesting use cases
1. Going around each player's turn in the multiple game
2. Managing the application life cyrcle of a giving operation systems
3. Implementing [pibnacci head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap)
