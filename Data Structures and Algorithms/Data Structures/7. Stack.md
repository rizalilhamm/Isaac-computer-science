# Stack
A stack is a Abstract Data Type that holds an ordered, linear squence of items. Stack is **FILO** (First in Last out).We can only add new item at the top of Stack and take a plate from the top of the stack. If we want to reach that not in the top of stack, we need to remove all plates that are above that one. We can only access the element that on the top of stack. the element that last added will be the removed first

Here the main method of Stack:
* Push
* Pop
* Peek >> return the copy of the element on the top of stack without removed it
* is_empty
* is_full

Here is implementation: [Stack in Python](https://github.com/rizalilhamm/Isaac-computer-science/blob/main/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Data%20Structures/stack.py)
